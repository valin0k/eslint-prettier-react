# ES Lint and prettier for react projects

Here is a simple and nice configuration for your react project

## Getting Started

Add ``` .eslintrc ``` and ``` .prettierrc ``` in root of your project and enable
eslint. Install needed packages locally or globally, depends of your preferences.


### Webstorm config

Go to ``` Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Code Quality Tools -> ESLint ```
and select eslint checkbox. That's it!
